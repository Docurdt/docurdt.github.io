I"U<p>I am currently a PhD student at Biomedicine Discovery Institute of Monash University, majoring in <strong>Machine learning and Bioinformatics</strong>.
My research topics include biological problems of <strong>Cancer image analysis</strong> and <strong>DNA/RNA/Protein sequence analysis</strong>, which are more challenges to application in terms of high-dimensional with small size datasets, unpredictable heterogeneous data, lack of annotations, etc.
I am keen to apply machine learning algorithms to the data of reality to solve challenging analysis tasks.
Stay playing, stay breathing!</p>
