<p>Gene essentiality is a core concept of genetics, and has important relevance in relation to fundamental areas such as evolutionary, and systems and synthetic biology, and applicability in drug development. Essential genes (EGs) are often responsible for important biological processes and cellular fitness in an organism, and are critical for its survival. The essentiality of a gene is highly dependent on various factors including the genetic context, genetic background of the host and environment (15). Hence, gene essentiality is not a static, but rather a context-dependent property of a gene.</p>
