<p>Systematic reviews serve many critical roles.
They can provide syntheses of the state of knowledge in a field, from which future research priorities can be identified; they can address questions that otherwise could not be answered by individual studies; they can identify problems in primary research that should be rectified in future studies; and they can generate or evaluate theories about how or why phenomena occur.
To ensure a systematic review is valuable to users, authors should prepare a transparent, complete, and accurate account of why the review was done, what they did (such as how studies were identified and selected) and what they found (such as characteristics of contributing studies and results of meta-analyses).</p>

<p>Up-to-date reporting guidance facilitates authors achieving this.
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (<a href="http://prisma-statement.org/">PRISMA</a>) statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found.
The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement, which consists of a 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews.
The authors are encouraged to refer to PRISMA 2020 early in the writing process.</p>

<h2 id="the-core-of-prisma">The core of PRISMA</h2>
<p>The core of PRISMA consists of three main parts, including <strong>(1) Abstract checklist</strong>, <strong>(2) Main checklist and an expanded checklist</strong>, and <strong>(3) flow diagram of review progress</strong>.</p>
