  The best practise is applying PRISMA as early as possible. It is critical to keep each step is clear and transparent.


Introduction

Systematic reviews serve many critical roles. They can provide syntheses of the state of knowledge in a field, from which future research priorities can be identified; they can address questions that otherwise could not be answered by individual studies; they ...

      What is the definition of gene essentiality (GE)?
Gene essentiality is a core concept of genetics, and has important relevance in relation to fundamental areas such as evolutionary, and systems and synthetic biology, and applicability in drug development. Essential genes (EGs) are often responsible for important biological processes and cellular fitness in an organism, and are critical for its ...

  Fabrice’s blog Deep Learning on a Mac with AMD GPU


An elegant solution for Deep Learning — PlaidML

Mainstream deep learning frameworks, such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, and Caffe 2, are not so friendly for AMD Mac.
Among the solutions introduced in Fabrice’s blog, PlaidML is an elegant one to me.
The installation and configuration of PlaidML can be found in the documentation of PlaidML.
